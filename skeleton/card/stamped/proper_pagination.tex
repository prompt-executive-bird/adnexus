% Condenses stamped.pdf by adding several of the sourced pages into a single
% page. This document assumes A6-size cards should be placed on US Letter paper.
% The maximum number of cards per sheet in this arrangement is 2. The page must
% be in landscape mode to accommodate this set up.
%
% Pages are listed in sets of 4, the odd pages being listed before the
% even pages in each set.

  % %% Calculation of delta(x,y)
  %
  % The delta values are the distances between each page in the block. As they
  % are not stacked vertically, delta(y) = 0. If delta(x) is operationally
  % defined to be the same as the horizontal margins, we have:
  %     L = 2w + 3delta(x);
  % where L is the long edge length of US Letter, and
  %       w is the short edge length of A6.
  % Or, equivalently,
  %     delta(x) = (1/3) * (L - 2w).
  % Noting that (L, W) = (11in, 8.5in) = (279.4mm, 215.9mm), and
  %             (l, w) = (148mm, 105mm),
  % we obtain
  %     delta(x) = 23.13mm.
  % Hence, delta(x,y) = (23.13mm, 0mm).
  %

  % %% Calculation of offset(x,y)
  %
  % When the block of pages is typeset, it is centered in the page. Unless the
  % margins need to be changed due to a restricted, non-centred printing area,
  % we can use offset(x,y)=(0mm, 0mm).
  %

  % FIXME: Requires a hard-coded specification of the page numbers. (To resolve
  % this, consider the following command:
  %     pdfinfo example.pdf | grep Pages | sed 's/[^0-9]*//'
  % This outputs the number of pages in a pdf document.)
